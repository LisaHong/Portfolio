            [insert circuit reflection]: My views on robotics changed after fiddling around with today's circuit activity because I realized that there is more to programming a robot than intertwinding wires. After this activity, I'm somewhat excited for the future of robotics but at the same time, I fear the dangers that may occur. I hope that in the future, we use robots to help us and not for unnecessary reasons. However, I fear that humans will increasingly rely on robots for other luxuries/benefits. Also, there will always be a possibility for malfunctions. What worked well today was 
            [insert blink led] insert first answer. Our team first talked about what kind of design we wanted to be displayed as the lightshow. We then created a layout of what we wanted our design to do (blinking, on, off, etc). Our teamwork could've improved if we all decided on what we wanted to do and in what way earlier because we were debating on what our design should do. We had trouble with the code and also ourr jumpwires and resistors made our product look really confusing and compact so we had to find a way to reorganized everything. We had trouble with looping because the eyes would not blink while the smile was in the ripple effect.  -->
